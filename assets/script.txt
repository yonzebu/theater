> hey.
- hey
> it's been a while.
- has it?
...yeah. maybe too long.
- yeah
...

...glad you could make it.
you made it just in time, it's just about to start.

[wait 5]
[start]
[wait 15]

...i know you're not supposed to talk during movies, but... idk if we'll get another chance.
> and... i think we really should be talking more.
- ...yeah.
i'm glad you agree.
- ...
it's ok. i can do most of the talking.

[wait 3]

honestly, i've been kind of worried about this whole thing.
> it's just, we've changed so much.
- have we?
...i think you know the answer to that better than me.
- i miss the old us
...i think i do too.
- change is scary
that's maybe a little trite, but... yeah.

> anyways, it's not just the change that's scary.
- is it me?
...yeah, kind of. but i think it's mostly part of the way i am, not about you specifically. if that helps.
- is it the movie?
nah, the movie's kinda nice, honestly.
- everything's scary
...yeah. i know. i feel it too.

> can i... ask what you think of this whole thing? talking, i mean.
- it's nice
...i'm glad.
- i don't wanna talk about it
...yeah, that's fair.
- i was willing to try it
...that's really i could ask of you.
- it sucks.
...oh.

[wait 1]

> sorry, do you... want me to stop talking?
- yes
...y'know, i... don't actually think i can? i- i'm sorry, you know how it is.
- nah
...thank you.

.........
> ...y'know, i realized something while setting this up.
- ?
> i don't think we're going to come out of this perfect, or even in a way either of us expects.
- that's ok
it's gotta be, doesn't it?
- ...or if it will even change anything?
...that's maybe what scares me the most.

i just, i worry that... this won't change anything about us. 
the knotted web between us will continue to fester, and we'll both continue to rot.
...and not the pleasant kind of rot, where we join the moss and leaves, but the kind that smells of dead flowers and rotting meat.
> heh. even when i'm trying to do something, i can't help but be afraid of something.
- i'm scared too
...i know. maybe it never goes away.
- this isn't scary
...it's probably good you feel that way.
- ...
...it's ok. you don't have to say anything.

i think... talking like this, at least, is better than nothing?
it's... movement, at least.
i really want to keep moving.
> i... hope you do too.
- moving is good
that's a relief to hear.
- i don't
...i want to change that. i don't know if i can, though, or even if i should.

i do kind of worry about where we might go from here, though.
if we keep anything up, that is.
> what if we head in the wrong direction?
- there is no wrong way
...you're right. the direction doesn't really matter, does it?
- i don't want to continue anything
...i've been afraid of that from the start.
- i'm scared of what's next
usually i'd try to reassure you, but... i'm worried the fear is right in this case.

[wait 2]

but this isn't about... what will be.
and... i wanted to ask you something about this.
not about that.
> do you... remember this?
- yes
i don't know if that's true. i hope it is.
- no
...i wish i did.

[wait 2]

> i think, though... that i wish there was more.
- me too
...yeah.
- do you?
...maybe not? i think i do? isn't that what matters?

[wait 5]

> do you ever... hope for something more?
- always
...i think we both do. maybe that's part of why we're here.
- sometimes
when we hope, i think in some sense we're unsatisfied with what we have. ...maybe that's not hope, though. desperation?
- never
i wish i could be like that.

[wait 7]

...
> does it hurt you, too?
- what?
...sorry, forget i asked.
- yes.
...i'm sorry. 
- are you ok?
i think you know the answer to that.

[wait 10]

what if... we just enjoyed the movie for a bit?
i'm sorry, i'm just... a little tired.
i want time to think.
and to just... live in the moment.
> would... that be okay?
- yeah
i'll be quiet now, then.
- do i have a choice?
...i need a break, so maybe not.
- fine
...thank you.

[wait 60]

i... have something to ask you.
but... i really think... you won't like it.
i don't like it.
but i think that, maybe, i have to ask you.

[wait 3]
i... really hope it's okay.
[wait 2]
so, uh...
[wait 2]
> why didn't you do anything more?
- i felt it was enough
...maybe it was. it's more than i expected.
- i ask myself that constantly
...but not in the past tense.
- ...
...yeah, i... don't know what i expected you to say.

[wait 5]

that question was too accusatory, wasn't it? i'm sorry.

[wait 10]

> ...do you... miss me?
- you never really left
...maybe not. maybe i should have.
- constantly
...i doubt it.
- i wish i did
...that's the worst part, isn't it?

> i don't blame you, you know.
- i do
just... don't blame yourself forever.
- you should
...we can be better than that.
- ...
...yeah. me too.

> really, though, i don't think it's something we could have changed.
- isn't it?
...even if it is, does it matter anymore?
- so we should just forget it?
i... didn't say that.

> i just think... we should move forward.
- to what?
...i think the movement is more important than where we go.
- why?
...what else is there to do?
- it's scary.
...yeah. i think... that's not always a bad thing.

but... we already talked about this.
moving, i mean.
> are we going in circles?
- not yet
...i think we're close, though.
- yeah
thanks for telling me, at least.

[wait 5]

> i just... i wish i could... say the right thing, to make it turn out alright for us.
- maybe there isn't a right thing
...yeah. i'm beginning to wonder if there ever is one.
- i do, too
maybe everyone does? i don't even know if the right thing exists, though.

[wait 5]

> i want us to do better. but i don't know if we can.
- me neither
> ...but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try?
- yeah
> do you think... we'll be able to try in ways that matter?
- maybe it's the trying that matters
...you might be right.
- no
that... scares me. not as much as the idea that we never try, though.

and... maybe i already knew that.

[wait 10]

you know... time is kind of a funny thing.
this is so short, but it spans such a long time.
and what happened with us took place over such a short time.
but still longer than this.
and... it feels like some things are longer than others.
but really, they weren't that long.
and it feels like no time has passed in some ways.
but i know it has.
and it scares me that it's passed.
but it already happened.
it scares me, but it already happened.
i can't change it.
i couldn't have changed time passing even if i tried.
[wait 3]
...i don't really know what my point is.
maybe i don't have a point.
> maybe i just want to talk, about something, anything i can think of.
- it's ok
i'm... really happy to hear that you even tolerate me.
- i know the feeling
...of course you do.
- it's a lot
...yeah. maybe too much.

[wait 10]

you know...
i think that i do miss you.
i don't know if you ever thought about me that way, though.
and... i think it's ok if you didn't.
> i don't know if i should think about me that way.
- ...i did
...i hope that wasn't too hard on you.
- i can't think about anything right
...me neither. and i keep thinking anyways.

...i don't know how much more i have to say.
i'm sorry.
maybe i shouldn't apologize.
i'm just worried i haven't said enough.
i worry that what i said wasn't good enough.
that us talking means nothing.
> that it won't change anything.
- what you said was never as important as that you said it.
...that's... far kinder than it sounds.
i guess i don't know what i expected you to say.
i'm grateful for everything you've said, though.

[wait 10]

...i'm really sorry.
i really have run out of things to say.
[wait 2]
> let's just enjoy the movie now?
- ok
...i'm glad you're here.
- ...
...
- finally.
...oh. i'm... i'm so sorry.

[ended]
...i guess that's it, then.
thanks for coming.
> did you enjoy it?
- yes
i'm glad.
- no
...that's ok.

> was it worth it?
- yes
i thought so too.
- no
...i wish it had been.

i... have to go now. 
> i hope to see you again.
- do you?
...i really want to think i do.
goodbye.
